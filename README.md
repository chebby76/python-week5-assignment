 # Superhero & Polymorphism Challenge 🦸‍♀️🎭

## Project Overview

This project is a programming exercise that involves creating custom classes to explore **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in object-oriented programming using Python.

### Goals
- Create a class representing an object, such as a Smartphone, Book, or Superhero.
- Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life, including constructors for initialization.
- Implement inheritance to explore encapsulation and polymorphism.
- Create a polymorphism challenge where multiple classes share the same method but define it differently.

## Activity Details

### Activity 1: Superhero Class with Inheritance
1. Define a base class `Superhero` with attributes like name, superpower, weakness, and team.
2. Create subclasses like `Flyer` and `Speedster` to represent specific types of superheroes with unique attributes.
3. Add a dedicated subclass for superhero women (`SuperheroWoman`) that introduces a new attribute, such as `emblem`.
4. Use constructors (`__init__`) to initialize each object with unique values.
5. Example objects:
    - Skyhawk: A flying superhero.
    - FlashDash: A ground-speed superhero.
    - Aurora: A superhero woman with healing abilities.

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
1. Design a base class `Entity` with a placeholder method `move()`.
2. Create subclasses like:
    - `Car`: Defines `move()` as "Driving 🚗".
    - `Plane`: Defines `move()` as "Flying ✈️".
    - `Dog`: Defines `move()` as "Running 🐕".
    - `Snake`: Defines `move()` as "Slithering 🐍".
3. Showcase polymorphism by calling `move()` on different objects.

## How to Run
1. Save the code to your local Python environment.
2. Execute the program to see superheroes introduce themselves and the polymorphism examples.
